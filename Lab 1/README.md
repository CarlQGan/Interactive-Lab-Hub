## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

_Setting:_ In our design, we are implementing a scenario based ambience lighting that can correspond to different modes of interations. More specifically, in the most common spaces that one might be at: workstation, bedroom, personal vehicle, etc.

_Players:_ The design is centered around one user, but is scalable to multiple users depending on the scenario (e.g. in shared spaces, etc.). For multiple users, it can be used as a status indicator.

_Activity:_ The user is the primary actor who interacts with the ambiance lighting device. The device changes lighting modes based on the user's activities and preferences.

_Goals:_ The goal of the player is to maximize their performance and stay in a good mood with the help of our ambience lighting system. For example, the ambience lighting system can help players to drive better according to their mood and their desired driving style. Another example is that our lighting system can reflect on the sleeping quality of the users and cheer them up if they are not in a good mood whenever they are in the room.

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

1. Understand and think of the target users/audience of the device, and try to become the user of the device, learn about what the user needs and preferences
2. Consider how the device will interact with users such as sound detection/motion detection
3. Try to build the prototype of the device and get user feedback as soon as possible
4. We might need to consider the device for a wide range of users such as people with disabilities
5. Track the progress by setting up checkpoints 


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

While acting, we might realize that timing could be one of the issues in sending messages to the device. For example, if the user's motion is too fast or too slow, it might cause the device to misinterpret the intended action. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

We have an idea that helps users to interact with devices effectively. By adding a short User Guidance, it could contain simple animations or instructional prompts that guide users on how to interact with the device in different scenarios. In addition, we also thought of further blending in the system with the surroundings.


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

The overall process of using Tinkerbelle is very convenient and hassle-free. It would be nice if some more features can be added. For example, when using the phone as a lighting device, we would like to see a full-screen mode that displays only the color, instead of having buttons on the screen at the moment. In addition, it would be great if it can work without private network or even internet.

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

After testing out the device in the physical environment, we further improved the design of the in-car display, and associated the weather forcasting feature with windbell. In such way, we can further incorporate our design into the natural surroundings of the prototyped settings, and provide our device with a more friendly touch.


## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

By designing the device, a few concerns might influence the way to design our product. Firstly, the device will be placed in multiple areas inside the vehicles or rooms; therefore, the installation is crucial. The design of the device should facilitate simple and easy installation. Secondly, the size and flexibility could also be one of the concerns. The places to install the device might be slightly different. For example, the device might be placed behind the vehicle's door handler or in the corner of the bedroom. By considering these cases, the device should be designed using bendable materials.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

In addition, here is a prototype for the weather/mood based windbell design:

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

Throughout this lab, Qianxin Gan and Mingze Gao collaborated together with equal contribution towards different parts of the design. In addition, we would also like to appreciate the generousity of Ziyang Wei.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
